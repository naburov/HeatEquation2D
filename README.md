# HeatEquation2D

Solution of 2D heat equation in C++ with finite difference method.

This is a toy example of the application of the finite difference method with VTK output. 
Mainly it was done to test VTK and c++ for the finite difference approach before implementing fluid dynamics project from: https://github.com/naburov/Hump3DFluidFlow
